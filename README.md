### Description:

<ul>
The objective of this work was to conduct a new-user analysis of metformin and active comparators to
describe associations between metformin as treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the subsequent
incidence of Long Covid over six months. We assessed metformin prescribed at the time of SARS-CoV-2
infection and new use of other off-label treatments: fluvoxamine, fluticasone, ivermectin, and
montelukast. Key secondary objectives included assessing the timing of metformin use relative to SARS-
CoV-2 infection, the influence of calendar time over the course of the pandemic, separating active
comparators, and describing the different definitions of Long Covid.
